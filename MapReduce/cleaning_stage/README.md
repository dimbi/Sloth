# MapReduce programs for cleaning Wikipedia data


To clean the data of links between articles use mapper\_pagelinks.py as the mapper and reducer.py as the reducer.
To clean the data on each invididual pages use the mapper\_pages.py as the mapper and reducer.py as the reducer.


## For Mappers:

To run files locally:
1. Use mapper\_pagelinks.py with example\_input\_pagelinks.txt
2. Use mapper\_pages.py with example\_input\_pages.txt

To examine preprocessed results look at:
1. for file corresponding to mapper\_pagelinks.py inspect results\_example\_mapper\_pagelinks.txt
2. for file corresponding to mapper\_pages.py inspect results\_example\_mapper\_pages.txt

## For Reducer:
For both files use reducer.py as the reducer. This is an identity reducer.
