This folder contains the project's data processing scripts for parsing, filtering and joining the raw Wikipedia data.
This folder also contains supplemental scripts that extract key statistics about the processed data.

To replicate the results of our study please execute the scripts scripts in the folders according the the internal READMEs in the following order:
